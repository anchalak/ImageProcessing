#Image Processing Projects

### This repository contains three image processesing and one image classification projects. Below is a summary of all four projects:

#### 1. Image Processing using DeOldify
In this Project, I will levarage DeOldify to colorize different types of images to get a better sense of how colorization works on diffrerent different types of images. DeOldify is a deep learning-based image colorization algorithm that aims to restore color to grayscale images. Below is a quick summary of how it works:

Input a grayscale image lacking color information.

Apply a decolorization step to remove remaining color information.

Utilize a GAN-based colorization model to generate a colorized version of the image.

Train the model on a dataset of colored images to learn colorization patterns.

Evaluate the colorization output for visual appeal and realism.
